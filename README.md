Library Management System

This Library Management System is a JavaScript application that manages books, patrons, and sections using Object-Oriented Programming principles. It allows users to store book information, track borrowing and returning processes, and organize books into sections. The system features regular and VIP patrons, where VIP patrons have borrowing priority. Key classes include `Book`, `Section`, `Patron`, and `VIPPatron`, each with methods for managing books and patrons. To get started, clone the repository, and open `library_management.js`. Contributions are welcome, and the project is licensed under the MIT License.
